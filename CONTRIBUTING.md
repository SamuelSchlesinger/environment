# Contributing Guidelines

Push anything you want, I will review it and see if it makes my experience
using this better! If there are users at any point, perhaps I will consider
their opinion as well. There are certain things that would be very appreciated:

- Combinators that decrease complexity, encoding common patterns.
- Different types with HasProgram instances that could be useful, I am not married to the particular encodings I chose to start out with. 
- Notions of composition: what are interesting and common ways these compose?
- Documentation! If anyone can write up tutorials on understanding concepts that people start to run into as difficult, that would be great.
- Issues are always appreciated as well, even if you don't suggest how to solve them, some sort of tale of how something sucked to use would go a long way.
