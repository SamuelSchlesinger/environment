# Environment

This is a project that is meant to help me set up and use my programming
environment to better effect. This may include libraries that I build for
myself, idioms that I want to encode in a library somewhere, etc. This is
the result of a long time of scattering my various ideas and creations into
many different places.

To use everything in this package, you will need to have some environment
variables set. One important one is

```bash
export ENVIRONMENT_BASE_PATH=<this-folder>
```

This folder will be used in a number of these scripts. The code in this
repository needs to be "self conscious", as it will be focused with easing
the process of editing and manipulating itself.
